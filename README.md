# Citibike-Tableau
Citibike is a public bike sharing program in New York City. They have been up and running since 2013; they have tracked every bike ride with their service, from location, starting point, time, and bike user. Upon looking at their data, I chose to dive into yearly trends, as well as the major trends of 2018. 

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Tableau

### Description
Big data involves a lot of cleaning! Citibike keeps detailed overviews of rider and bike histories; however, these record types have not stayed congruent throughout the years. Luckily we have Pandas to fix that problem. 
#### The 2018 Daily Rider Information 
This dashboard displays the seasonal trends that can be used to predict trends in upcoming years. Citibike offers 1-day passes and 3-day passes. These differ in popularity depending on the time of year; the fall saw a spike in 3-day passes sold, total number of miles traveled, and total number of trips taken. 
#### Starting Location Stats
This dashboard compares the popularities of different bike stations from 2017-early 2019. These insights directly impact bike operations and maintenance. Do bike stations where bikes see longer journeys need more attention than those which do not? Do bike stations with historically low visotors really need to be in service? What can be done to maximize efficiency at stations like Grove St, which has seen over 76,000 rides? 

### Getting Started
Don't just take my word for it! See for yourself:
* Open the tableau-graphs folder and right click the dashboard you would like to view
If you want to see the cleaning process:
* Clone into this repository
* Using Jupyter Notebook, open data-cleaning folder to select the file you'd like to view
